# UnitySnippets

Collection of useful modern snippets to use in unity!

The motivation for this repo is for Training in Generics, better code patterns/practices and smart use of the great coding language (C#).

# ObserverPattern

Useful to detect changes on values

# Factory Pattern

Simple generic Factory Pattern

# DI (Dependency Injection)

Tentative to create a smart DI for Unity/C#. The general idea is to have classes instantiated/shared across the system without the need to manually instantiate or handle.

Currently it only works with 1 DI

The end result will be:

- Work with multiple DI directly set on the monobehavior
- High performance caching for instances
- Instantiate monobehaviors
